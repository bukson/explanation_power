## Usage

Store your code/software in an open-access GitHub repository where it is publicly available. 
Record the URL needed to retrieve the code in the metadata table found in the required article templates. 
Please avoid using GitLab or other hosting platforms as this will slow the editorial process of your submission.

Please make sure that the permanent link to the GitHub repository includes the following requirements:

a. README.md and LICENSE.txt files. Your README.md file should be well-written, explaining the use, installation, 
and purpose of your proposed software. Please see other notable and well-cited GitHub repositories 
(including official GitHub guidance) for a better understanding of code documentation.

b. Source code in a repo/src directory.

All software and code must be open source and released under a recognized legal license 
such as those listed below and by the Open Source Initiative. Any licenses which are not listed 
below need to be approved by the Journal's Editorial Office.

Any additional material that you consider relevant to your submission can be uploaded and submitted either 
as "Supplementary Material" or "Supplementary data".
